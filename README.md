# Clipboard Health Senior Engineer Interview Task

This project involves cleaning data from a CSV filled with nurse information and visualizing the data. To accomplish this there were 3 general steps:


1. Implementing a python pipeline to ingest and clean the data.
2. Loading the data into a MongoDB.
3. Serving the data from an Express web server as an API and visualizing it using React and D3. 

# Cleaning the data

 * **Fast:** KaTeX renders its math synchronously and doesn't need to reflow the page. See how it compares to a competitor in [this speed test](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
 * **Print quality:** KaTeX’s layout is based on Donald Knuth’s TeX, the gold standard for math typesetting.
 * **Self contained:** KaTeX has no dependencies and can easily be bundled with your website resources.
 * **Server side rendering:** KaTeX produces the same output regardless of browser or environment, so you can pre-render expressions using Node.js and send them as plain HTML.

KaTeX supports all major browsers, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, and IE 8 - IE 11. A list of supported commands can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/wiki/Function-Support-in-KaTeX).

## Usage

You can [download KaTeX](https://github.com/khan/katex/releases) and host it on your server or include the `katex.min.js` and `katex.min.css` files on your page directly from a CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.7.1/katex.min.css" integrity="sha384-wITovz90syo1dJWVh32uuETPVEtGigN07tkttEqPv+uR2SE/mbQcG7ATL28aI9H0" crossorigin="anonymous">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.7.1/katex.min.js" integrity="sha384-/y1Nn9+QQAipbNQWU65krzJralCnuOasHncUFXGkdwntGeSvQicrYkiUBwsgUqc1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### In-browser rendering

Call `katex.render` with a TeX expression and a DOM element to render into:

```js
katex.render("c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}", element);
```

If KaTeX can't parse the expression, it throws a `katex.ParseError` error.
